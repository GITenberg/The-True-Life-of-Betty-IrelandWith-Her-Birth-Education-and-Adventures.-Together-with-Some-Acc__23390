<p>It is agreed on all Hands, that <i>Betty Ireland</i>
was a younger Daughter by a <i>second
Venter</i>; let, at first, to run wild in the
Woods, cloathed with Skins and fed with Acorns;
till a <i>famous Hunter</i> took her in his
Toils, and, liking her <i>Countenance</i>, gave her to
a Son of his, a <i>Lad</i>, to bring up. The <i>Girl</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was born to a good Estate, but ill tenanted,
and run to waste. Her <i>Farms</i> neither <i>meared</i>
or bounded, her Rents never paid, as she had
no <i>certain</i> Tenants, and had little more to claim
than a Pepper-corn Acknowledgment. She
had no Relation to manage her <i>Demesnes</i>, and
could hardly be said to be possessed of any
thing.</p>

<p>In this Condition the young <i>Sportsman</i> found
her, was fond of her at first, and resolved to
marry her; and <i>happy</i> had it been both for
<i>him</i> and <i>her</i>, if he had kept his Resolution,
and performed the <i>Contract</i>. But he hankered
after his elder Brother&rsquo;s <i>Estate</i>, and, on his
Death, suddenly got the Tenants to <i>attorn</i> to
<i>him</i>, and basely dispossessed his <i>Nephew</i>. But
instead of an <i>Estate</i>, he got nothing but a
<i>Law-suit</i>, lived in <i>Broils</i>, and dyed a <i>Beggar</i>.
Whereas had he quitted all Pretensions at home,
married <i>Betty</i> and minded her Concerns, he
had soon been in a Condition not to envy his
Brother; and, perhaps, had left a <i>second Family</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
little inferior in <i>Greatness</i> to the first.</p>

<p>This was the only Chance ever <i>Betty</i> had
to make a <i>separate</i> Fortune, set up for herself,
and be <i>independent</i> of her <i>Sister</i>. She was ever
after <i>beholden</i> to <i>her</i> for maintaining her <i>Rights</i>,
settling her <i>Affairs</i>, and bringing her <i>Tenants</i>
to Reason.</p>

<p>Neither <i>Betty</i> or her Sister were yet of
Age, but the Younger far from it, and continued
under such <i>Guardians</i>, as the <i>Elder</i> recommended,
and had chosen for herself. It was
natural to think they should chiefly be employed
in ordering the Affairs of <i>Blanch</i>, and
be less attentive to benefit the other. Accordingly,
from time to time, they sent <i>Proxies</i>,
to let Leases, keep her <i>Courts</i>, and <i>force</i> Possession,
where the Tenants held over. Little,
however, was done for <i>Betty</i>, though they put
her <i>Sister</i> to great Charges; nor did she thrive
in the World to any Purpose, &rsquo;till she came
under the Care of a good <i>orderly Gentlewoman</i>,
who was also <i>Guardian</i> to <i>Blanch</i>, a notable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<i>Manager</i>, and very affectionate to her <i>Wards</i>,
understood their Business to a hair, and was
never to be imposed on or <i>over-reached</i>. Every
thing she put her hand to prospered, and every
thing against her miscarried.</p>

<p>When she first looked into <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Affairs,
she found them in a manner desperate; her
small Revenues had been embezzled by <i>Agents</i>,
Farms set to <i>insolvent</i> Tenants, <i>double</i> Leases
made out, huge <i>Fines</i> taken in Hand and sunk
in their own Pockets. She was preyed upon by
Vagabonds and <i>Outlaws</i>; and, to compleat her
Misfortunes, a <i>Foreign Count</i> fell in love with
her, an odious Monster and <i>braggadocio</i> Huffer.
He swore bitterly no one else should have her,
and to support his Claim, brought in his Pocket,
a <i>pretended Licence</i> from the <i>Spiritual Court</i>,
and a Pack of <i>outlandish Goths</i> along with him,
to take Possession of her Freehold, and break
down her Gates. But her <i>Sister</i> generously
came in to her Assistance, repelled Force by
Force, and rescued her from a Tyrant Ravisher,
built Houses for herself, and Fences for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Tenants, and left some of her own People with
her to instruct them in Trades and Husbandry.</p>

<p>She was then, it might be thought, in a
Way of making herself respected, both by her
own and her <i>Sister</i>&rsquo;s Tenants, and not stand in
need of any more Supplies from them; and if
the <i>good Woman</i>, her guardian, had lived to
bring Matters to any Kind of Establishment,
Things had been better. But she unfortunately
died, more, however, to her <i>Sister</i>&rsquo;s Disadvantage
than <i>hers</i>; for the <i>Guardian</i> had chalked
out a Track of Proceeding for <i>Betty</i>, which she
could hardly miss to follow. The <i>Elder</i>, however,
was inconsolable for the Loss of her <i>Guardian</i>,
and resolved, for the future, to manage
her Concerns by the Assistance of a <i>Steward</i>, a
Sort of a Cousin to her <i>Guardian</i> deceased, but
no way allied to her, in Worth or Understanding.
He minded nothing but Hunting and
<i>Puppet-shews</i>, Feasts and Revels; and though
the uncomeliest of an <i>ill-favoured Race</i>, spent his
Lady&rsquo;s Money in adorning his own Person, instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of <i>fencing</i> her Grounds. He was laughed
at by one half of the Neighbours, and despised
and gulled by the other. In a Word, he was
every Way unfit for the Charge.</p>

<p>His Son succeeded to the Place; he was a
grave-looking, orderly young Man, main religious,
and skilled in the <i>Customs of the Manor</i>.
Both the Sisters had great Hopes their Affairs
would thrive under his Management. <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s,
indeed, went on well for a while; but, in the
End, both of them had Cause to complain,
and curse the Day they had bethought them
of employing a <i>Steward</i> in their Concerns. He
was not so great a Fool as his Father; yet nothing
he put his Hand to succeeded. He was
<i>bubbled</i> by every <i>Neighbour</i> he dealt with, and
choused by every <i>Tenant</i> he trusted. His Word
could never be relied on, as he had always
some quibble to evade it. His Wife made him
hated by the Tenants; and for a finishing Stroke
to his undoing, and compleat the Ruin of his
<i>Wards</i>, he pretended the <i>Steward</i> had a Right
to hold Courts without <i>Juries</i>, and by his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Authority levy Money for <i>Repairs</i>. The Tenants
would not endure this Invasion on their
Rights, but stoutly opposed it; and, after a
hard Struggle, got the better, turned him out
of the <i>Stewardship</i>, and some of them finding
him one Day at a <i>why-not</i>, tied him to a Rope,
and hanged him in a Frolick.</p>

<p>The Office of a <i>Steward</i> was now abolished
for a Time, and the elder <i>Sister</i> resolved to take
her Affairs entirely into her <i>own Hands</i>, and
have neither <i>Steward</i> or <i>Guardian</i> for the future.
The Condition, indeed, of <i>both</i> was deplorable.
There had been nothing during the
<i>late Quarrel</i>, but Riot and Plunder, Rents unpaid,
and Soldiers quartered at Discretion; so
that, in order to retrieve their Affairs, it seemed
necessary to put things on a <i>new Footing</i>, and
trust none but themselves to manage them. But
whatever they intended mattered but little.</p>

<p>Among the Soldiers quartered on them was
a bustling Knave, who from a Corporal had
come to be a Captain. He was bold as a Lion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and <i>crafty</i> as a Fox. He had cajoled his Soldiers
to stand by him; and pretending <i>Compassion</i>
for the Sisters, offered, or rather forced
himself, to be their <i>Guardian</i>. They only complied
because they could not help it; and he
took more <i>rule</i> over them, than ever <i>Steward</i> or
<i>Guardian</i> had done before him.</p>

<p>He seemed, indeed, to mend Matters in the
Beginning, but, in reality, did <i>unrepairable</i> Damage
to <i>Blanch</i>, though considerable Services
to <i>Betty</i>. The Neighbours all around thought
they were thriving apace, and began to envy
their Greatness. The Reason of which was, that
he always took care to have the <i>Girls</i> well
dressed, especially when they went a <i>visiting</i>,
and sent Word before-hand (for he was <span class="nb">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span>
proud) that all the World should <i>Cap</i> to them
as they passed along. He stinted them in every
thing else, but <i>spent</i> all he could <i>rap</i> and <i>run</i> to
make them <i>fine</i>. <i>Betty</i> was <i>bashful</i>, and kept
pretty much at home; but when <i>Blanch</i> went
<i>abroad</i>, she made a <i>flaming</i> Appearance, <i>held</i>
up her Head among the <i>Highest</i>, and <i>insulted</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the <i>Proudest</i> with her <i>Braveries</i>.</p>

<p>But all the while Things were but <i>uncomfortable</i>
at home, though she made such a <i>tearing
Figure</i> when abroad. Nothing to be had for
Farms, by reason the Soldiers put <i>in</i> and <i>out</i> as
they pleased. No <i>Leets</i> or <i>Manor Courts</i> were
minded. No <i>taxing</i> for <i>Repairs</i> and <i>Bounds</i>,
but the Soldiers <i>taxed</i> for <i>Contingencies</i> as much
Money as they could hear any one had. So
that the <i>Tenants</i> found themselves in a worse
<i>Pickle</i> than ever they had been under the
Management of a <i>Steward</i>. They longed for
Courts and <i>Inquests</i>, and to have every thing
set on the old Bottom again.</p>

<p>They heard of a <i>poor Boy</i>, a Son of the late
<i>Steward</i>&rsquo;s, who had run away from the <i>Lands</i>
the Time his Father was hanged, and was now
grown up to Years of Discretion. As he had
<i>bit</i> a good while on the Bridle, they thought he
might be tamed, more careful than his <i>Father</i>,
and do them more Justice and Kindness. They
brought him home in a <i>Hurry</i>; and, as it&rsquo;s natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to run from one Extreme to another,
were sure they were all <i>made</i> when they got him
into the <i>Stewardship</i>.</p>

<p>It must be owned, he was a pleasant, good-humoured
Fellow as ever broke Bread, civilly
behaved, and by no means wanted Capacity for
the Business. But he was <i>idle</i> to a Degree, followed
<span class="nb">W&mdash;&mdash;ng</span> and Horse-racing; and provided
he could borrow Money enough from the
<i>Tenants</i>, or get <i>Presents</i> from the <i>Neighbours</i>, to
treat his Wenches and buy them <i>Top-knots</i>, never
heeded how <i>Accounts</i> were settled, how he
held the <i>Courts</i>, or how he paid the Servants.
Farm-houses went to decay, and Strangers forestalled
the Markets. Few People, however,
could find in their Heart to hate him. They
had a Love for him, though he was daily undoing
them: For it was always <i>their Humour</i> to
like a <i>boon Companion</i>; and instead of crossing
his Prodigality, they followed his Example,
<span class="nb">wh&mdash;&mdash;ed</span> it away from the highest to the lowest,
revelled and caroused for <i>dear Blood</i>, and were
never better pleased than when the last Penny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was a going. It became a <i>Fashion</i> to be Bankrupt;
to be Rich, was to lose all Credit; and to
be Just, was the Mark of a Scoundrel.</p>

<p>But though the <i>elder Sister</i> was well-nigh
undone by him, he did a good Turn by <i>Betty</i>,
and sent one of his <i>Cousins</i> to take care of her
Concerns, who had a good Farm of his own
under her, and was well-beloved over the whole
Estate. He kept <i>Leet</i> and <i>Court-Baron</i>, presented
Vagabonds at the Sessions, and gave Rewards
for apprehending <i>Out-laws</i>. He set the
Tenants to Work, <i>lived constantly among them</i>,
and looked himself into every thing. <i>Betty</i> began
to thrive, and was less expensive to her
<i>Sister</i>, who had wasted huge Sums to keep her
Head above Water. She stuck to Business, and
prospered mainly, &rsquo;till the <i>Steward</i>&rsquo;s Brother got
himself into the Place, who played <span class="nb">H&mdash;&mdash;ll</span> with
every thing, and brought the two Sisters to the
Brink of Ruin.</p>

<p>He was rash, senseless, obstinate, and ill-minded;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
none of the Neighbours would <i>deal</i>
with him, or the <i>Tenants</i> trust him, as there
was no believing one Word he said, or promise
that he made; for he had taken an Oath when
he was young never to speak Truth. He began
his Vagaries by putting the <i>Curate</i> in the <i>Stocks</i>,
for refusing to teach a new <i>Catechism</i> of his <i>own
Invention</i>. He entered into a Plot to secure the
<i>Elder Sister</i> in the House of Correction, and
make her do Penance in the Church, under
Pretence of Carnal Conversation. He agreed to
sell <i>Betty</i> to a Cousin of his, a great Lord in the
Neighbourhood, who longed to have her for a
Waiting-woman to his Wife. So the <i>Tenants</i>
made short Work with him, rose one and all,
and sent him a-packing to his Cousin, where he
was fain to be a Serving-man, since he could
not send <i>Betty</i> to be a Serving-maid.</p>

<p>Both the <i>Sisters</i> took an Oath never more to
have a <i>Steward</i> again, and to abolish the very
Name from among them, with a reserve to his
Daughters, who had married abroad, and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
good sort of Women, in their Way.</p>

<p>Here it was that <i>both the Sisters</i> had their
Affairs put on a sure and lasting Footing. The
Rights of the <i>Tenants</i> were narrowly examined,
and all pretended Powers of the Steward abolished
by a Rule on the <i>Court Manor</i> Books.
There was, indeed, some Difficulty in bringing
it about, and a power of Money laid out on the
Occasion. But it was well bestowed had it been
twice as much.</p>

<p>There was a <i>Stripling</i> among the neighbouring
<i>Fens</i>, who had married a Daughter of
the <i>Steward</i>&rsquo;s, and had got the best Estate there
by the Diligence of his <i>Ancestors</i>, who were
the principal <i>Engineers</i> in <i>draining</i> and <i>banking</i>
the Country. They had often borrowed Money
from <i>Blanch</i> to carry on the Work, to <i>stem</i>
the Water when the <i>Fen-men</i> were in despair,
and prevailed on her to send a strong <i>Posse</i> of
her Tenants to keep off some malicious Neighbours,
who would ever and anon be <i>boring</i>
Holes in the <i>Dikes</i>, and endangered the Overflowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of all the Land they had gained. If
ever these <i>wretched People</i> shewed any thing that
looked like <i>Gratitude</i>, it was to the Family of
their <i>Engineers</i>; and this young Man improved
it to his own Advantage, and that of <i>Blanch</i>,
whom he acknowledged the Preserver of the
<i>Fen-men</i>, who deserved Preservation on no other
Account than to make them <i>Pack-horses</i> and
<i>Carriers</i>. They were, indeed, a middle Species
between Men and Brutes, and chiefly compounded
of the latter. But this young <i>Adventurer</i>
had got the Ascendant over them, and,
as we ordinarily say of vicious Horses, had made
the <span class="nb">D&mdash;&mdash;l</span> come out of them. He <i>ringed</i> them
by the Nose, and <i>bled</i> them with the <i>Spur</i>, and
so throughly<!--Page 18: sic--> <i>broke</i> them (for he was a special
Horseman) that they never kicked or plunged
when he was <i>in the Saddle</i>; but, as the Nature
of Beasts is, became the fonder of him the
rougher he handled them.</p>

<p>When he understood that <i>Blanch</i> and her
<i>Sister</i> were so hampered and <i>Tyrannically</i> treated
by the <i>Steward</i>, he came to their Assistance, supplied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
them with Money, which he raised from
the <i>Fen-men</i>, and fairly set them free from his
Oppression and Rapine, reversed his <i>Grants</i>, cancelled
his sham Leases, restored Possessions,
<i>Leets</i> and <i>Manor-Courts</i>, made up <i>Fences</i> for the
Tenants, and so strongly secured their <i>Copyholds</i>,
that there is no likelihood they will ever be
<i>ousted</i> or much <i>disturbed</i> again. And, to crown
all the Services he had done the two Sisters,
he <i>recommended</i> them, before he parted, to the
Care of a <i>neighbouring Lord</i>, a Cousin of his own,
and a <i>right honest Man</i>, who proved a Father to
<i>them</i> and their People, defended their <i>Rights</i>,
and secured their <i>Properties</i>.</p>

<p>And yet <i>Blanch</i> could never rightly like the
<i>Fen-man</i>, as she called him, though he had
done so much for her. She could not comport
herself with his Manners and his Humour,
hated the Servants he brought with him, complained
they were too costly to her, though she
kept them sparingly, and even quarrelled (so
exceptious are Women) to the Cut of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Cloaths, and the Colour of their <i>Liveries</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>Betty Ireland</i> had more Gratitude than
her <i>Sister</i>, adored him while he stayed with her,
and to this Day <i>remembers</i> him as her <i>great Deliverer</i>,
the Protector of her Life, and the
Founder of her Fortune.</p>

<p>She, indeed, had double Obligations, as
her Condition was more helpless than her <i>Sister</i>&rsquo;s,
and she had more severely felt the <i>Tyranny</i> of
the <i>Steward</i>, who, because she could not so readily
complain of him, had first <i>stripped</i> her of
all she had, and then sold her to Bondage. But
both <i>Sisters</i> ought surely to reflect, that all the
Happiness, and all the Security they have since
enjoyed, has been owing to the <i>Friendships</i> he
procured them, when he put them under the Protection
of <i>his Cousins</i>; and that he has effectually
banished the <i>Stewards</i> thereby, who would
doubtless otherwise be meddling with their Affairs,
and use them worse than ever they did
before, as coming <i>in without Leave</i>, they would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
act without Controul.</p>

<p>But maugre all these Considerations, <i>Blanch</i>
was glad when he left her, and ready to leap
out of her Skin for joy. She thought of nothing
but Diversions, spent her <i>Time</i> and <i>Money</i> in
<i>visiting</i> and <i>dressing</i>, ransacked the Globe to set
off her Person, and, it must be owned, she never
looked handsomer in her Life. Wherever
she went, she was adored as an Angel, surrounded
by admiring Throngs, and Thousands
hanging on her <i>Look</i>.</p>

<p>But all this was empty Pageantry and too expensive
Glory. She ran herself in Debt to uphold
this Appearance, mortgaged her <i>Estate</i>, and bartered
her <i>Stock</i>, for the vain Applause of flattering
Knaves, and scoundrel <i>Tradesmen</i>. It was
Time to pull in, and keep a Hank in the Hand.
She saw her Folly, and doffed her <i>Gear</i>. It was
better <i>go plain</i> than run in Debt for Finery; and
enough she had to do to pay the Debts she had
contracted in her <i>Fit of</i> Vanity.</p>

<p><i>Betty</i> all the while was minding Business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
at home, and her Affairs prospered amain. Her
<i>Tenants</i> became industrious, and her <i>Estate</i> improved;
yet she never thought herself sufficiently
<i>secure</i> till she got under the new <i>Protection</i> her
<i>Deliverer</i> had provided. Her Situation is particular.
She has a strange Mixture of People
on her Estate, who are always at Daggers drawing
with one another, and a mighty Hindrance
to her Business. They are <i>Whites</i>, <i>Blacks</i>, and
<i>Black</i> and <i>White</i>. The <i>Whites</i> only are allowed
to be <i>Land-holders</i>; but the <i>last</i>, by hiding half
the Face when they converse with her, pass for
<i>Whites</i>, and make good their <i>Titles</i>. The first
are dreadfully maligned by the <i>Blacks</i>, who
are unhappily the more numerous, <i>lay old Claims</i>
to her <i>Lands</i>, and are ever watching for an Opportunity
to make a <i>Riot</i>, and take forcible Possession.
&rsquo;Till now they were too much favoured
by her <i>Sister</i>, which checked the Industry of her
Farmers.</p>

<p>But when they found they had nothing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fear, either at home or abroad, they began in
earnest to improve <i>their Concerns</i>, as they were
sure they were working for themselves, and in
no Danger of being dispossessed, by Virtue of
<i>chimerical</i> Claims, and <i>Antediluvian Proprietors</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Blacks</i>, indeed, immediately made a
<i>Riot</i> on this new Settlement, but could not get
Possession; and, lately, a <i>young Jackanapes</i> pretended
a <i>Right</i> to be <i>Steward</i> to <i>both Sisters</i>, by
Virtue of a <i>Patent</i> he had got from the last
<i>Steward</i>, as if he had a Right to dispose of a
<i>Place</i> he had been turned out of himself. He
came on the Lands, however, with a <i>bloody-minded</i>
Crew of <i>skirtless</i> Vagabonds, drove off
the Cattle, robbed the <i>Hen-roosts</i>, and <i>swaggered</i>
at so <i>unmerciful</i> a Rate, that <i>Blanch</i> was
frightened out of her Senses, and was fain to
<i>send</i> for a Dram of <i>Gin</i> to restore her Spirits.
But if she was frightened, her <i>Guardian</i> was not,
and had a <i>Month&rsquo;s Mind</i> to find out the <i>Varlet</i>
in Person, and tread him under his Feet. But
as he could not leave the <i>Hall-house</i> where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>Court was sitting</i>, he sent a <i>Lad</i> of his own to
take Account of him, who did the <i>Business
tightly</i>. He was a <i>well-mettled Blade</i>, and <i>Steel</i>
to the <i>Back</i>. He came up with him at the Corner
of a Farmer&rsquo;s Yard, where he gave him
and his <i>Desperados</i> a wofull Drubbing, kicked
him i&rsquo;the <span class="nb">A&mdash;&mdash;e,</span> <i>soused</i> him in the <i>Horse-pond</i>,
which he swam over to save his Bacon, and
looked so miserably scared in his Passage, that
it&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;ll never <i>try the Ford</i> again.</p>

<p>For a good while before this Alarm happened
(which proved nothing but a <i>Bugbear</i>)
both the <i>Sisters</i> had a fair Opportunity of minding
their Concerns, and getting above the World.
<i>Blanch</i> might have paid her Debts, and had
Money to the fore; but it was ever her Misfortune
to be <i>ill-served</i> by almost all she employed.
Never, sure, had Lady so <i>unhandy</i> a Pack about
her, and, indeed, it was impossible it could well
be otherwise; for she did not chuse her <i>Servants</i>
because they were <i>fit</i> for this, or that <i>Office</i>, but
because they asked, and would have it, or be
horribly out of Humour else, would make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Noise and <i>Uproar</i> at every <i>Court-Leet</i>, terrify
the <i>Tenants</i> at every <i>Ale-house</i>, with strange Stories
of Designs on their <i>Copy-holds</i>, and wicked
<i>Plots</i> just ready to begin; &rsquo;till they turned their
Heads, and set them madding. So that the
poor Lady was fain to <i>take them in</i>, to keep
Peace at Home, and to pay them Wages for
not doing her Business. The Consequence of
which was, she had <i>Clerks</i> could neither write
or read; Book, and Cash-keepers, that could
not <i>count</i> or cast up, or ever heard of a <i>Ballance</i>
in their Lives. And so ridiculous was her Compliance
in this Point, that she had once a Lady
to curry her Horse, and a <i>Fishmonger</i> for a <i>Grass
Bailiff</i>.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Tis true, she would often change her Servants,
but not a <i>Barrel the better Herring</i>. If
she got one, by chance, knew any thing of his
Business, the <i>rest</i> never left boddering her &rsquo;till
they had him out. It should never be said they
demeaned themselves so much as to serve with
one, who would spoil every thing by his <i>Rashness</i>,
and disgrace the Service by his <i>Ignorance</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Now, by <i>Rashness</i> they meant <i>resenting Insults</i>
and <i>Injuries</i> done their Lady; and by <i>Ignorance</i>,
not knowing how to <i>buy</i> and <i>sell</i>, and live by
the <i>Loss</i>. So that, all Things considered, it
were a Marvel her Affairs should be in better
Plight than they are, or her Debts be paid with
more Ease and Expedition.</p>

<p><i>Betty</i>, in the mean time, is come to an
opulent Fortune, has her Rents well paid, and
her Farms daily improving, and would improve
ten times more, if her <i>Sister</i> could see her own
Advantage so far, as to give her that Encouragement
she is daily giving to <i>Strangers</i>, who give
her nothing in Return but their Envy and Ill-will.
But as it is, <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s in a good Way, and
makes the most of a bad Market. And since
she must not work for her <i>Sister</i>, she works for
herself.</p>

<p>It had been a Custom of hers to buy every
thing she wanted from her <i>Sister&rsquo;s Tenants</i> and
<i>Tradesmen</i>, though they used her abominably,
and put off upon her the worst Goods they had.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
If the Farmer had damaged Hops, he sold them
to <i>Betty Ireland</i>; if his Malt was blinked, away
it went to her; and the <i>Pothecary</i> thought his decayed
Drugs good enough for <i>Betty</i>, and instead
of burning them, laid them by for her, as tho&rsquo;
she were not a Christian, or had the same Inside
as her Sister.</p>

<p><i>Betty</i> could not help this contemptuous
Treatment, as she had nothing she wanted
at Home, by reason of her Laziness, though
all Materials in abundance were at hand. &rsquo;Tis
incredible to relate, but, at the Time I am
speaking of, certain Fact, on her whole Estate
there was not one to be found could make a
Buckle for her Shoe, or a Pin to her Sleeve;
a Pot, a Spit, or any Utensil to cook her Victuals,
might as well be found among the <i>Tartars</i>
as with her. She took every thing from
her <i>Sister</i> at what Price she pleased, unsight unseen,
and bought the <i>Pig in the Poke</i>. Necessity
roused her from Stupidity and Sloth, she encouraged
her Tenants to apply to Trades, assured
them of a ready Market, and rewarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
those that did their Work the best; and, at present,
has every thing within herself. And tho&rsquo;
it must be owned a very unreasonable, and <i>not
to be endured</i> Instance of her Impudence, she
proposes to dress in her own Manufactures, and
does not mean to trouble her <i>Sister</i> any longer
for <i>cast Cloaths</i> and <i>unmerchantable</i> commodities.
But in every other Respect, she desires to keep
up a good Correspondence with her, and is daily
doing every thing in her Power, to gain her
Favour, and procure her Regards. Whatever
she can spare from her ordinary Expences, she, in
some Shape or other, makes a Present of to her
<i>Sister</i>, in Acknowledgement for Services done, and
Kindnesses receiv&rsquo;d in her <i>Minority</i>. Has <i>Blanch</i>
a Favourite whom she cannot readily provide for,
a poor Relation on hand, or Retainer to the Family,
a broken Projector, or cast Serving-man;
she has no more to do but acquaint <i>Betty</i> with
it, who quickly puts him on a <i>creditable Pension</i>,
and never refuses, though she run herself in
Debt by it. Is <i>Blanch</i> engaged in a Brangle with
her <i>Tenants</i>, (who, by the way, are cursedly
litigious) and hard put to it for Hands to do her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Business, <i>Betty</i> makes an Offer of sending her
People to help her, and maintaining them abroad
at her own Charges. Does a Tenant of <i>Blanch</i>
come to favour her with a Visit, she receives
him with Hospitality and Respect, and would
sacrifice her Fortune to make his Entertainment
agreeable.</p>

<p>If all this Complaisance should fail of its Effect,
and not so succeed as to keep <i>Blanch</i> in good
Humour, &rsquo;tis easy to say where the Fault must
lie, and from what Causes her Discontents arise.</p>

<p>In the first Place, it has ever been the Fate
of her <i>Domesticks</i> to be invincibly hated by her
<i>Tenants</i> without Difference or Distinction, (for,
to say Truth, they have no Head for <i>Distingo</i>&rsquo;s:)
There is but one Thing in the World they hate
more, and that is <i>Betty Ireland</i>. Now, the <i>Servants</i>
bear hard on <i>Betty</i>, to curry Favour with
her Sister&rsquo;s <i>Tenants</i>, who would go half Way to
the <span class="nb">D&mdash;&mdash;l</span> to have <i>Betty</i> <span class="nb">d&mdash;&mdash;d,</span> are for ever cursing
her, and laying all their Misfortunes at her
Door. If the <i>Clothier</i> loses his Business, or has his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Goods on Hand, &rsquo;tis <i>all &rsquo;long</i> of <i>Betty</i>: Wheat
bears no Price, for <i>Betty</i> has glutted the Market.
Whereas, in Fact, they never keep the same
Markets. But they forget, they are all so idle
and debauched, such gobling and drinking Rascals,
and so expensive in <i>blew Beer</i>, that they
are forced to put a double Price on every thing
goes to Market; so that no Body will deal with
them. Indeed, if it incenses them, that <i>Betty</i>
won&rsquo;t buy, burn her <i>own Goods</i> and take off
<i>theirs</i>, they must e&rsquo;en turn the Buckle behind.
<i>Blanch</i> will be wiser, for her own sake, than
lay Stresses on her <i>Sister</i>, from whom she gets
more than <i>by all the World beside</i>, only to humour
a Set of grumbling Churls, who don&rsquo;t
know what they would be at; and so extremely
senseless, that it&rsquo;s Matter of Wonder, their
Oxen don&rsquo;t ride them to the Market, and sell
them. &rsquo;Tis true, a <i>Linen-weaver</i>, one of <i>Blanch</i>&rsquo;s
Tenants, prevailed on her lately to withdraw
some Encouragement she had given <i>Betty</i>, and
transfer it to a <i>Stranger</i>. But that was owing to
bad Advice given her, by a <i>Clerk</i> she has since
turned off, and sent a stroling among <i>Brandy-shops</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and <i>Ale-houses</i>, to <i>backbite</i> his <i>Lady</i> for want
of other Employment.</p>

<p>Another Cause of <i>Blanch</i>&rsquo;s Dislike to her
<i>Sister</i> was, a Fright she took, when she was just
<i>delivered</i>, at some ill-looking People, who came
from <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Lands, and appeared under her
Window. There&rsquo;s no doubt but <i>Blanch</i> has as
much Courage as any genteel Lady ought to
have, and must have been in a Fit of low Spirits
when she, and all her Tenants from her, took
so senseless an alarm, as to run distracted thro&rsquo;
Fear of half a Dozen Fellows cutting all their
Throats in one Night, who were ready to run
through Fire and Water for Fear of being hang&rsquo;d
themselves; yet certain it is, from this ridiculous
Incident, and from nothing else, can be derived,
that universal Hatred shewn her by
<i>Blanch&rsquo;s Tenants</i>, though they have never seen,
spoken with, or had any Dealings whatever, either
with <i>Betty</i> or her <i>Tenants</i>. People must be
<i>generous</i>, as well as <i>brave</i>, to forgive those that
frighten them.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another Cause of Dislike among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
such as have Dealings with <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Tenants who
come on Business, or to visit her <i>Sister</i>, that they
run in debt with them, and don&rsquo;t pay. So do
all their Neighbours, for that matter; but they
complain of none but <i>Betty</i>, though it is very
well known they make ample Reprisals on her;
and <i>one Bite</i> of theirs, is worth a hundred of
<i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s, who are none but such as are despised
at home, and can get neither Credit or Company
there; for <i>Betty</i> is not yet arrived to that
Degree of Politeness, as to court and caress
<i>Highway-men</i> and <i>Sharpers</i>, only because <i>they
keep good Company</i>, and are Gentlemen of <i>nice
Honour</i>, but sincerely wishes her <i>Sister</i> to hang
them all.</p>

<p>The last I shall mention (and, to be sure, a wise
Cause of Dislike it is) <i>Betty</i> goes once, at least,
every Year to pay her Sister a Visit, carries all
her Money, puts on her best Cloaths, lives
high as long as she has a Penny left. This vexes
her <i>Sister</i>, and many a <i>Slut</i> and <i>Flirt</i> she calls
<i>Betty</i>, at the very time she is throwing away her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Money with both Hands for the Tradesmen and
Shoeboys to scramble up. They are both Fools;
<i>One</i> for shewing this Contempt, and the other
for putting herself in the Way of it.</p>

<p>It is wished, but probably in vain, that the
two <i>Sisters</i> would come to a better Understanding.
They that have considered the true Interest of
both, see plainly that the <i>elder</i>, and consequently
the <i>younger</i>, must be shortly undone, if these
Bickerings and ill Offices continue. So <i>unnatural</i>
a Quarrel between near Relations must make
them despised by all the <i>Neighbours</i> around, who
are hourly taking the Advantage of it, and <i>profiting</i>
themselves by the Hindrance the <i>Sisters</i>
give to each other. But their Manners and Disposition
are so different, that it&rsquo;s next to impossible
they should ever love one another; tho&rsquo;,
for mutual Interest, and to make that Figure in
the Eye of the World which two <i>Ladies</i> of their
Distinction and Fortune ought to assume, their
Friends may agree to promote <i>jointly</i> their Interests,
and never heed how peevish and untoward
<i>either</i> of them may be, or pay any Regard to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<i>fanciful Aversions</i>, and ungrounded Jealousies,
which are always inseparable from a female
Breast.</p>

<p>Tho&rsquo; in this History I have rather copied the
<i>chaste Brevity</i> of <i>Cornelius Nepos</i>, than the diffused
and <i>chatty</i> Eloquence of <i>Plutarch</i>; I shall conclude,
in Imitation of the latter, with a Description
of the two <i>Ladies</i>, their Persons, Manners,
and Inclinations; and, in drawing the <i>Parallel</i>,
with Freedom represent, their Vices as well as
<i>Vertues</i>, their Faults as well as their Perfections.</p>

<p><i>Blanch</i> is by much the taller, neat, timbersome,
and well made, a lively Look and a
sprightly Air. <i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Face is full out as <i>handsome</i>
as her <i>Sister</i>&rsquo;s, tho&rsquo; not so regular, has more
<i>variety</i> and striking Beauties, and, with equal
<i>Dressing</i>, would appear more lovely than the
other; but she&rsquo;s a <i>Slattern</i> in her <i>Dress</i>.</p>

<p>As to their <i>Tempers</i>, <i>Pride</i> is the prevailing
Passion of the <i>first</i>, and <i>Vanity</i> of the <i>second</i>;
from which naturally, and unavoidably arises,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
every observable Character of their Mind and
Manners. <i>Blanch</i>&rsquo;s Pride makes her selfish and
reserved, contemptuous, if not rough, in her Behaviour.
<i>Betty</i>&rsquo;s Vanity makes her <i>open</i> and communicative,
fond of <i>shewing herself</i> on all Occasions,
complaisant, and caressing, to a Degree of
Flattery. As <i>Blanch</i> does not know what it is to
have Love or Affection for any one but herself,
so she expects it from no one, but claims a great
deal of Respect. <i>Betty</i> doesn&rsquo;t know what Respect
for her means, but to gain her Love and
Liking would part with all she had. <i>Blanch</i> is
frugal in the main, not very hospitable, and seldom
lavish but in private Pleasures. <i>Betty</i> is
hospitable to Prodigality, lavish to Folly, and
thinks nothing a Pleasure that others don&rsquo;t share
in. Hence it comes, that the first loves her Money
above all things, the <i>second</i> less than any
thing she has any value for at all; that one is
anxious to <i>get</i>, the <i>other</i> in haste to <i>spend</i>. <i>Blanch</i>
has a good Understanding, but does not <i>know
the World</i>, and is commonly <i>choused</i> by her
Neighbours. <i>Betty</i> has no Opportunity of <i>knowing
the World</i>, as her <i>Sister</i> won&rsquo;t let her go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
much abroad or converse with the <i>Neighbours</i>;
she has but little Experience, and, to be sure,
is not very <i>wise</i>, but is the quickest in the World
at finding out <i>a Fool</i>. The <i>elder</i> is <i>cautious</i>, and
hides carefully every Fault she is conscious of;
the <i>younger</i> is not conscious of any Fault of Folly
whatever; so they all come out in her <i>communicative
Fits</i>, which seize her as often as she gets
a Stranger to talk to. <i>Blanch</i> is the more censorious,
and <i>Betty</i> the greater Liar.</p>

<p>If either of the <i>Ladies</i> think the Picture not
like, let them call to mind the Story of a famous
Painter, who had drawn the Portrait of a young
Man, whostood very well with himself, but didn&rsquo;t
please him. &ldquo;You have drawn me,&rdquo;<!--Page 36: added missing end quote--> said he,
&ldquo;exactly the <i>Reverse</i> of every thing I am.&rdquo;
<i>If it be so</i>, replied the Painter, <i>that must be your
Likeness</i>, and set the Picture on the Head.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
